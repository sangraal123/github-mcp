# GitHub Issue to MCP Converter

This is a minimal Python application that demonstrates integration with the GitHub API by fetching issue data from a repository and converting it into a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) format.

This example can be used as a simple starting point for registering with the [GitHub Developer Program](https://developer.github.com/).

---

## ✨ Features

- Uses GitHub REST API to fetch issue data
- Converts GitHub Issue to structured MCP-compatible JSON
- Easily adaptable to your own repositories
- Simple to run locally with minimal dependencies

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- A GitHub personal access token (classic)
- The following Python packages (see `requirements.txt`):
  - `requests`
  - `python-dotenv`

---

## 🔧 Setup

1. **Clone this repository** (or copy the files locally):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sangraal123/github-mcp.git
   cd github-mcp-demo

2. **Create a `.env` file** and add your GitHub token:

   ```env
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
   ```

   > You can generate a token at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
   > Only `public_repo` scope is needed.

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ How to Run

Run the script with:

```bash
python main.py
```

It will output MCP-formatted JSON like this:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://modelcontext.org/context",
  "@type": "GitHubIssueContext",
  "repository": "octocat/Hello-World",
  "issueNumber": 348,
  "title": "Testing comments",
  "body": "Let's add some, shall we?",
  "labels": []
}
```

---

## 🔁 Customize

To use your own repository and issue, edit these lines in `main.py`:

```python
OWNER = "your-username"
REPO = "your-repository"
ISSUE_NUMBER = 1  # Your issue number
```
